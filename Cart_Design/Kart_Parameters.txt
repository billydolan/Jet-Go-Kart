Frame
- Welded Aluminum tubing
- Cut to shape aluminum or light-weight steel plate for base
- 10 gallon fuel tank spot, with shielding if possible
- fire extinguisher mount 
- lightweight bucket seat (prob get off FB marketplace or find one in scrapyard, TBD)
- Multi-point harness, at minimum 3 point, if not 5 point
- Steering wheel, column
- Axles and rims
- keep low to the ground and potentially will need a spoiler for dual turbines, or if a certain height is not attainable
- Some sort of smaller shocks atleast for handling bumps, potential instabilities, etc
- * Roll cage? *
- Front splitter

Wheels
- Disc brakes, all 4 Wheels
- could potentially use brakes similar to a higher performace bicycle, using mineral oil
-- Otherwise investigate hydraulics, etc
- Air holding tires instead of solid rubber most likely -> TBD
- guards/fenders on the frame to protect the tires
- Proper brake lines connected to the brake pedal

Personal Equipment
- Helmet
- Fire resistant or proof suit/clothing 
- Some sort of neckbrace, especially for dual turbine build
- microphone in helmet or earbuds

Fuel
- Can be changed, but for single operation, 5-10 gallons minimum
- T-Slot framing to hold the tank in place
- fuel lines diameter: * Fill in later*
- Kerosene, with JetCat anti-static oil mix. 
-- Price per gallon: 

Turbine Mounts
- Machined Aluminum Mounts
- Three bolts for each side of a turbine
- Put a shield behind the driver in form of a steel plate
- For 2 turbine operation, common electronics config, but seperate fuel tanks and mounts on either side of the driver?
- 

Turbine
- Current V1 model would use 1 JetCat P300-Pro with integrated electronics, providing 300N, ~67 lbf at stock
-- V2 would use twin JetCat P300-Pros
--- Will need to redesign the app to handle 1 & 2 turbine operational modes
- JET NETS MUST BE USED

Initial Turbine Modifications
- Start with modifying the nozzle to work on optomizing base level thrust
- Weight reduction for the nozzle if possible
- Create a more optomized Inlet or cowl to improve intake
-- These could be scoops or similar to cars that directs air into the turbine

Complex Turbine Modifications
- Afterburner design, testing, and use
-- Create an afterburner, that can be as efficient as possible (an ironic statement but possible)

- A turbofan adaptation with proper ducting feeding into afterburner for higher oxygenation of the flow -> easier to burn
-- Component matching calculations and blade design for the current shaft
-- Manufacturing would be costly
--- Testing to validate the risk of surge is minimal, in reality needing to be non-existent will be difficult if numerical models are not very fine tuned.

- Combustor Optimization for efficiency and output
-- Expensive to manufacture
-- Modeling software even avaliable?
--- Can do calculations using resources from my combustion classes, canterra and CEA in Matlab (CEAM)
--- Time consuming and very complex, especially for creating entirely new combustors, no matter the size reduction
---- Papers avaliable to assist with this, but anything like code will likely not be able to be obtained.

Electronics
- An integrated controller with either an interface for changing thrust on the steering wheel, like paddles, or connected to a gas pedal
-- Some sort of touch sensor that drops the turbine(s) to idle thrust, then shutoff, if not interacted with in a certain period of time
--- Will need a way to work around this for idle periods, especially during testing. 
--- Pedal method would require a sensor and tension to take into account the pressure applied to the pedal. 

-- Could work on custom ECU to replace JetCat ECU-Software and run only my own, TBD
-- This would need to be HEAVILY DOCUMENTED, I am not doing any guessing games about anything in the slightest
-- Integrated screen on the wheel, displaying fuel consumption, rpm, etc
--- Raspberry pi and some sort of screen or simple tablet with a pi like I saw years ago at Zin Tech

- Spedometer?

'JetOp' Modifications
- Need to get displays of values for operation
-- Uni CS Senior-project may solve this, at least at the base level

- Ability to ultilize commands and functions for multiple turbines
-- Some sort of input based on detecting how many turbines are connected, etc?
---automatic app behavior changes, will need to find how to properly display each turbine's performance
-- Can simplify charts to tachometers and bars only, no need for airspeed
-- Split screen setup with the pi?

Documentation
- Create this as a markdown document at some point, could add to ReadME with a license for use at own risk, etc
-- Code will be as is and timeline is whatever I define it as

- Create a Gantt chart or similar that could be integrated into the portfolio, or on the reporistory for the Jet go-kart
-- Otherwise use a png of an excel gantt chart

- Cite sources and provide background for documentation/calculations, especially for things like cycle analysis, etc
-- logic behind methods taken, textbooks/sites used, etc

Propulsion resources 
-- Textbooks, Online examples, videos, etc will need to be listed. 

- Create a flow chart for parts of the projects
-- Why the selected path, and what the upcoming steps are / what steps have been 

- Project Updates, on a schedule of weekly or monthly?
-- Hammer out a simple format, can be posted on GitHub and socials

- Social Media documentation through:
-- Instagram: bdsprojects
-- Youtube: TBD

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
-- Python
-- C++ 
-- C#

- Arduino IDE

- Visual Studio Community
-- Compiling:
--- C++
--- C#

- MATLAB
-- Mathworks own MATLAB software & IDE

- SolidWorks 
-- 3D Modeling 
-- Decent fidelity simulations
--- Fluids
--- Thermal
--- Stress

- Converge CFD
-- Flow simulations

- Power BI
-- Data visualization and or Gantt chart

- Excel 
-- Potential Gantt chart
